    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
        University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the
        "National Youth Administration"
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
        in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
        how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
        Forestry Service
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
        laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
        returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
        pest-resistent plants.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
        Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
        work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
        other applied science.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
        leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
        pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
        different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
        varieties for each major climate on Earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
        season, doubling wheat yields
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
        with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
        well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
        strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
        mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
      </li>
      <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
        increase their maize and sorghum yields
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
        University
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
        supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
        we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
        are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
        people were selecting the best breeds."
      </li>
      <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
        contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
        scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
